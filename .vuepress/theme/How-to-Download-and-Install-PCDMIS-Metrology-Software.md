## What are the benefits of using PC-DMIS?
 
PC-DMIS is a flexible and powerful metrology software that can help you improve your measurement accuracy, efficiency, and productivity. Here are some of the benefits of using PC-DMIS:

- PC-DMIS works with a variety of metrology hardware and sensors, from Hexagon and third-party manufacturers, giving you a unified user experience across all your measurement operations. You can also switch between different sensors within a single measurement routine, such as touch probes, laser scanners, white light sensors, and roughness sensors.
- PC-DMIS has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to create and edit measurement routines, even for complex geometries and surfaces. You can use graphical icons, drag-and-drop features, auto features, and CAD models to simplify your programming process. You can also use the Summary Mode to view and modify your measurement routine in a simplified way.
- PC-DMIS has a comprehensive set of measurement algorithms and functions that enable you to perform accurate and reliable measurements for various applications and industries. You can use PC-DMIS to measure gears, blades, sheet metal parts, freeform surfaces, and more. You can also use PC-DMIS to perform GD&T analysis, alignment, best fit, scanning, reverse engineering, and reporting.
- PC-DMIS has a cloud-based integration with HxGN SFx | Asset Management software, which allows you to monitor and manage your metrology assets from any device. You can view the performance, quality, events, and OEE of your metrology equipment, as well as receive real-time alerts and notifications. This helps you optimize your asset utilization, maintenance, and uptime .
- PC-DMIS has a rich set of modules and extensions that enhance its functionality and capability. For example, you can use PC-DMIS Gear to measure gears easily and accurately, PC-DMIS Vision to reduce the time spent developing inspection programs for vision systems by up to 75%, PC-DMIS NC to perform in-process metrology on CNC machines, and PC-DMIS Portable to measure with portable devices such as arms and trackers.

With PC-DMIS metrology software, you can achieve high-quality measurement results that drive better decisions and outcomes for your design and manufacturing processes.
